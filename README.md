# Breakout Game

## Project Overview
**Breakout Game | Built with Processing (Java-like language)**  

Developed a 2D breakout-style arcade game using the Processing environment, featuring:

- Multiple levels with increasing difficulty  
- Interactive sound effects (background music, start & end game sounds)  
- Special bricks: grow/shrink paddle, gain/lose lives, destroy nearby blocks  
- Advanced mechanics: multi-hit bricks, moving blocks, increasing ball speed  
- Mouse control for paddle movement  
- Object-Oriented Design: **Ball**, **Paddle**, and **Block** classes for modularity & scalability  

---

## Technologies Used
- **Processing** (Java-like language)  
- **Processing Sound Library** (for background music & effects)  
- **OOP principles** for modular design  

---

## How to Run
1. Install the **Processing IDE**.  
2. Open `breakout.pde`.  
3. Run the sketch to start the game.  
4. **Control:** Move the paddle using your mouse.
